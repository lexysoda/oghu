# oghu
Like [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) but ugly, non-customizable, and probably full of errors.

But it probably only took a bit longer than reading through the humongous codebase of hugo,
and maybe I learned something along the way :shrug:.

## usage
* `oghu` populates public
* `oghu new path [title]` creates a new file under `path`

## todo
* [ ] cleanup the rendering process, especially the passed template data
* [ ] use `block` and define main template
* [ ] make parser configurable
